> Within light there is darkness,
but do not try to understand that darkness.
Within darkness there is light,
but do not look for that light.
Light and darkness are a pair
like the foot before and the foot behind in walking.

-- From the Zen teaching poem [Sandokai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandokai).

The goal of halfmoon is to cultivate balance in propensity score models.

## Installation

You can install the development version of halfmoon from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("malcolmbarrett/halfmoon")
```

## Example

halfmoon includes several techniques for assessing the balance created by propensity score weights.

```{r example}
library(halfmoon)
library(ggplot2)

# weighted mirrored histograms
ggplot(nhefs_weights, aes(.fitted)) +
  geom_mirror_histogram(
    aes(group = qsmk),
    bins = 50
  ) +
  geom_mirror_histogram(
    aes(fill = qsmk, weight = w_ate),
    bins = 50,
    alpha = 0.5
  ) + scale_y_continuous(labels = abs)

# weighted ecdf
ggplot(
  nhefs_weights,
  aes(x = smokeyrs, color = qsmk)
) +
  geom_ecdf(aes(weights = w_ato)) +
  xlab("Smoking Years") +
  ylab("Proportion <= x")

# weighted SMDs
plot_df <- tidy_smd(
  nhefs_weights,
  race:active,
  .group = qsmk,
  .wts = starts_with("w_")
)

ggplot(
  plot_df,
  aes(
    x = abs(smd),
    y = variable,
    group = weights,
    color = weights
  )
) +
  geom_love()
```
